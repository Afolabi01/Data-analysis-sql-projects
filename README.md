# Data Analysis in SQL
This are SQL projects using the Postgres flavor.
This project had the data cleaned in Google Sheets before the table was created in VS code and the values were copied in.
The date format was changed with the CUSTOM FORMAT function on Google Sheets and then loaded into VS code(due to the accepted date type in Postgresql).
After the table was created and values were copied,I proceeded to ask various questions making use of Aggregated functions, Where clause, CTEs, Subqueries and Window functions.
I made use of comments to highlight the Questions being answered(asked).
